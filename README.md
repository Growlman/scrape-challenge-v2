# scrape-challenge-v2


#### This assignment consists of two technical products. I attempted the following deliverables:

#### Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.

#### Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.
#### Please note I ran into a lot of trouble when I got to the graphing section of deliverable #2. Tried restarting my kernel, clearing it, reopening it, but still needs some more work later to properly display.
